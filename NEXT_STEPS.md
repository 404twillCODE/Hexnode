What I recommend you do next (in order)
Set up Discord server (I can give you channel layout + templates)
Enable GitHub Discussions + labels using GITHUB_SETUP.md
Add a short FAQ + “What’s coming” section on the website
Post 1–2 screenshots/GIFs to make it feel real
Share publicly (Discord invite link is already wired)
If you want, tell me your Discord server name + rules/roles you want, and I’ll draft the full channel structure + welcome message.
Also, do you want me to push the latest changes to GitHub? If yes, tell me a commit message and I’ll push.
