Summary of what’s in place and how it fits your support idea:
Hero text (overview, not “we’re building”)
It now reads:
“Nodexity is a local first Minecraft server stack: desktop app to run and manage servers, with a launcher and hosting options on the way. Your worlds and data stay on your machine unless you choose otherwise.”
So it’s a clear product overview (what it is, what’s included, where data lives), not a roadmap line.
In-site support (Discord-like) and profiles
Doing support on the site (and later in the app) instead of sending everyone to Discord is a good fit for early access:
One place for “how do I…”, “this broke”, “what does X mean” without context switching.
You can tie threads to app version, launcher, or hosting and keep history.
Later you can add in-app support that uses the same account and threads.
For that, profiles/login do make sense:
So people have a stable identity (name, optional avatar) and you see who’s who.
So you can have “my threads” / “my tickets” and link app ↔ website.
So you can (optionally) gate “create thread” or “reply” to logged-in users to cut spam and bots.
You don’t need full “Discord-like” on day one. A simple start could be:
Forum-style: categories (e.g. Server Manager, Launcher, Hosting, General), threads, replies. Accounts for posting; reading can be public.
Or ticket-style: “Open a support request” → form + thread. Account links request to user.
Then later: same account works in the desktop app for “Get help” or “Open a thread,” and you can add DMs or “talk to team” if you want. So yes: planning for profiles/login is justified mainly by this in-site (and later in-app) support experience.
